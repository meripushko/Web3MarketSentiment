    about:
      'Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency originally described in a 2008 whitepaper by a person, or group of people, using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. It was launched soon after, in January 2009. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer online currency, meaning that all transactions happen directly between equal, independent network participants, without the need for any intermediary to permit or facilitate them. Bitcoin was created, according to Nakamoto’s own words, to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.” Some concepts for a similar type of a decentralized electronic currency precede BTC, but Bitcoin holds the distinction of being the first-ever cryptocurrency to come into actual use.',

    about:
      'Ethereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain system that features its own cryptocurrency, Ether. ETH works as a platform for numerous other cryptocurrencies, as well as for the execution of decentralized smart contracts. Ethereum was first described in a 2013 whitepaper by Vitalik Buterin. Buterin, along with other co-founders, secured funding for the project in an online public crowd sale in the summer of 2014. The project team managed to raise $18.3 million in Bitcoin, and Ethereum’s price in the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) was $0.311, with over 60 million Ether sold. Taking Ethereum’s price now, this puts the return on investment (ROI) at an annualized rate of over 270%, essentially almost quadrupling your investment every year since the summer of 2014.',

    about:
      'Founded in 2017, Chainlink is a blockchain abstraction layer that enables universally connected smart contracts. Through a decentralized oracle network, Chainlink allows blockchains to securely interact with external data feeds, events and payment methods, providing the critical off-chain information needed by complex smart contracts to become the dominant form of digital agreement. The Chainlink Network is driven by a large open-source community of data providers, node operators, smart contract developers, researchers, security auditors and more. The company focuses on ensuring that decentralized participation is guaranteed for all node operators and users looking to contribute to the network.',

    about:
      'Polygon, previously known as MATIC network, is a Layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain. MATIC is the native token for Polygon. Its initial goal was to improve the transaction processing speed and reduce transaction costs — both of which are apparent issues with Ethereum. Overtime, Polygon has evolved into a network platform for building and launching interoperable blockchains, using Proof-of-Stake sidechain and finalizing transactions on the Ethereum main chain afterwards. Regarding NFTs, Polygon has been utilized by many projects to avoid the excessive Ethereum gas fees. You’ve probably seen projects with their main collection on Ethereum, whilst other companions or craftable NFTs are on the Polygon network.',

The Binance Exchange is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world as of January 2018, facilitating more than 1.4 million transactions per second. Users of Binance Coin receive a discount in transaction fees on the Binance Exchange as an incentive. BNB can also be exchanged or traded for other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, etc. Binance Coin was created in July 2017 and initially worked on the ethereum blockchain with the token ERC-20 before it became the native currency of Binance’s own blockchain, the Binance Chain.',

    about:
      'Hex is an Ethereum-based token that bills itself as the first blockchain certificate of deposit (CD). Just like traditional CDs offer an improved interest rate to customers who agree to leave a lump-sum deposit untouched for a set amount of time, Hex holders can stake batches of HEX tokens for specified amounts of time. During this time, they may not access those tokens without severe penalties—but when the specified time period is complete, Hex holders can receive HEX rewards. Hex was launched in 2019 by founder Richard Heart. It has received criticism for being a scam or a potential Ponzi scheme, despite having a market capitalization of over $30 billion as of Feb. 1, 2022.',
